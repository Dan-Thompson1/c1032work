 * Instructions:
 * 1. Press run and you should see the output:
 *      MY_CONST is: 10
 *      Printing 10 again
 *    On a linux machine or a Mac, use the commands:
 *      cc preprocessing.c
 *    to compile the program (assuming it is in a file 
 *    called preprocessing.c). Then the command:
 *      ./a.out
 *    to run the program.
 * 2. Enter the following command in the
 *    console on the right:
 *      > clang-7 -P -E main.c
 *    the output is this main.c file after 
 *    preprocessing but before compilation.
 *   
 *    Comments below tell you what to expect.
 *
 *    On a linux machine or a Mac, use the command:
 *      cc -P -E preprocessing.c
 *    to run the preprocessor (assuming the program file is
 *    called preprocessing.c).
